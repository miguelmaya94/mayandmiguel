 <div id="two"><img src="images/grad.jpg" alt="selfie2" id="selfie2" Align= "right" width="140" height="140"/><p>I am  27 years old, born and raised in East County San Diego. I graduated in the spring of 2012 from Granite Hills High School, which is located in El Cajon, California. I have a dual bachelor's in Graphic Designs and Software Development from California State University Fullerton and Bellevue University.

<div id="three"><img src="images/selfiet.jpg" alt="selfie3" id="selfie3" Align= "right" width="140" height="140"/><p> In the summer of 2012, I moved to Orange County to attend my first year at California State University, Fullerton. At the time, I was urgently seeking a job, so I decided to apply to several places. On April 12, 2013 I hired at the Disneyland Resort, which opened many doors for me. I graduated with my BA of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and Application Design in 2018.

  <div id="five"><img src="images/DSC_7130.JPG"  alt="selfie5" id="selfie5" Align= "right" width="140" height="140"/><p> Through the Disney Aspire Program, I was able to return to school and receive my second BA from Bellevue University, which is located in Omaha, Nebraska. On June 2020, I received my BA of Computer Science in Software Development.
