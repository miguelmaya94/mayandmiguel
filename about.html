                I am  27 years old, born and raised in East County San Diego. I graduated in the spring of 2012 from Granite Hills High School, which is located in El Cajon, California.

                In the summer of 2012, I moved to Orange County to attend my first year at California State University, Fullerton. At the time, I was urgently seeking a job, so I decided to apply to several places. On April 12, 2013 I hired at the Disneyland Resort, which opened many doors for me. I graduated with my BA of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and Application Design in 2018.
